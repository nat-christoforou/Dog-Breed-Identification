# Dog Breed Identification

In this competition, we are provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to practice fine-grained image categorization. How well we can tell the Norfolk Terriers from the Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, this might be a more difficult problem than anticipated. Our predictions would be evaluated on Multi Class Log Loss between the predicted probability and the observed target.
